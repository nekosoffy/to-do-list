# To-do List

:arrow_forward:  **[Live preview!](https://nekosoffy.github.io/to-do-list/)**

This project consists of a task management website where the user can create their own projects, each with the possibility for multiple tasks. It features a clean interface with project selection and information editing. Each task can have a title, description, due date, notes, priority and a customizable checklist. The data is stored entirely separate from the DOM display, and may populate the user's local storage.
